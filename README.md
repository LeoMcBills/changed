0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

In this project, I have implemented some of the Control Flow Tools in my programs that is the if/elif/else, loops and functions.

0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
	Used random a python module to generate random numbers from -10 to but not 10.
- For all positive numbers printed, 'is positive' is stated
- For all negative numbers printed, 'is negative' is stated
- For 0, 'is zero' is stated

1. The last digit
	Check whether last digit of a random number generated by the Random python model is greater than 5, equal to 0 and less than 6 but greater than 0.

2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
	print a string of alphabets without a next line

3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
